<h1>Hi, I'm Aleko!</h1>
<p>I am a Computer Science undergraduate at the University of Utah. My main passion is in Mobile/Web App development, with work done in IOS/Android platforms, as well as React/React Native. My other interest is in cybersecurity. I enjoy completing CTFs and hearing about new exploits that people come up with and implementing best security practices in the apps I develop.</p>
